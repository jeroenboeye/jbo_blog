<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.jeroenboeye.com/blog/solar-panel-analysis-pt-1-exploration/">first post</a> on my solar panel dataset we did some exploration and found a number of interesting patterns. One of these was the effect of temperature on the efficiency of the panels which we investigated further in the <a href="https://www.jeroenboeye.com/blog/solar-panel-analysis-pt-2-temperature-and-efficiency/">second post</a>. Another interesting pattern found while exploring the data was that for a number of months the maximal power throughout the day did not follow the expected bell shaped curve. Let’s load the <a href="https://github.com/jeroenboeye/jbo_blog/blob/master/static/files/solar_power.csv">data</a> and visualize the maximal values per time of the day for June and December so you get an idea of what I’m talking about.</p>

<p>Looking at the highest values for each time of the day we get an asymmetrical shape with lower maximum values in the morning in June while we get less than expected maximum values around noon in December. This pattern is caused by two trees to the east and south of my home which cast a shade on the roof during different times of the day. The tree to the south is not too close to the house and only when the Sun’s elevation is very low in winter does it’s shade reach the roof.</p>
</div>
<div id="visualising-the-obscuring-objects" class="section level3">
<h3>Visualising the obscuring objects</h3>
<p>While I know that the trees are behind this pattern I was wondering if we could derive their location and shape from the data. If we could somehow get a value for the power loss for each timestamp in the dataset we should be able to couple this data to a position of the Sun at that time using the <strong><code>solarpos</code></strong> function from the <strong><code>maptools</code></strong> package. Then we could create a panoramic picture where each pixel is a position of the Sun throughout the year as seen by the panels. The solar positions that consistently yield too little power should then match the trees. This sounds like a fun idea, but to get there we first need to get an idea of the power loss per timestamp. We’ll have to create a model that gives us the theoretical maximum output for each timestamp and then calculate the difference with the observed values.</p>

<h3>Visualising a full year of solar positions</h3>

The resulting shapes are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analemma">analemmas</a> and they are really interesting. Back in ancient times they gave astronomers headaches since they cause small deviations in the time read from sundials throughout the year. The issue was eventually resolved when they came up with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_time">equation of time</a>. I recommend a dive down this Wikipedia rabbit hole but for now, let’s get back to our solar panel data!</p>
</div>
<div id="modelling-maximal-power-output" class="section level3">
<h3>Modelling maximal power output</h3>
<p>We want a model that produces nice, symmetrical, bell shaped curves that are bigger in summer and smaller in winter. We could go for an approach where we simply try to create the expected curves using, for example, a normal distribution and some seasonal variable. While this approach would certainly work, it would treat the underlying effects as a black box. Wouldn’t it be more interesting if we could actualy simulate the effects at play and let the expected curve emerge by combining them? To do this we have to think about what is behind the variation in power yield. In winter the Sun transfers less energy to the panels because of it’s lower elevation but what exactly causes this power loss?</p>
<div id="energy-loss-due-to-spreading" class="section level4">
<h4>Energy loss due to spreading</h4>
<p>Image you carry a flashlight in a dark room. When you point it directly at the wall (90° angle) you get a small circle that is intensely lit. However, if you stand close to the wall and point the flashlight somewhat sideways you light a bigger surface. The same energy emitted by the flashlight is now spread out and each square centimeter in the lit area now receives less. We can calculate this effect with <strong><code>cos(pi/2 - angle)</code></strong>. When we transform a 90° angle to radials we get <strong><code>pi/2</code></strong> and when we enter this in the function we get the cosine of zero which is 1 or 100% spreading efficiency. In Belgium the Sun has a maximal elevation of 62° which has a spreading efficiency of 88%. During the winter solstice the Sun only reaches 15.3° at noon which has a spreading efficiency of only 26%. Fortunately, the panels themselves are somewhat inclined (20°) towards the south so that even in winter the angle of arrival is closer to 35° (57% efficiency). However, this inclination results in a more complex spreading effect because the panels now point in a particular direction. Both effects are estimated in the code below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># angles in degrees to angles in radials
# the &#39;_deg&#39; part of the variable name shows it&#39;s in degrees
deg_to_rad &lt;- function(angle_deg){pi * angle_deg / 180}

# vertical spreading effect
get_vertical_spreading &lt;- function(angle_deg){
  cos(pi / 2 - deg_to_rad(angle_deg))
  }

# When the Sun points to the south we should add 20° to the
# solar elevation to get the correct angle since the panels
# are inclined by 20° towards the south.
# However if the Sun were to shine from the north we should
# detract 20° from the elevation. The negative cosine 
# should do just this for us.
adjust_horizontal_angle &lt;- function(angle_deg, azimuth_deg){
  angle_deg + 20 * -cos(deg_to_rad(azimuth_deg))
}</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="energy-loss-due-to-traveling-through-the-atmosphere" class="section level4">
<h4>Energy loss due to traveling through the atmosphere</h4>
<p>A second, less straightforward, effect that decreases the energy transfer from the Sun to the panels at lower solar elevations is the fact that the distance traveled through the atmosphere becomes larger. As the light rays make their way through this mass of air they often collide with the molecules and become scattered. It is this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering">effect</a> that makes sunsets so beautiful and makes the sky above above us appear blue instead of black. Some clever people have studied this effect in great detail and we can take their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_mass_(solar_energy)#math_I.1">equations</a> from Wikipedia to learn that at a 90° angle the energy per square meter is about 1051 Watts. At 62° (Belgium summer solstice) we get 1019 Watts/m² which is still quite good. However at 15.3° in winter we fall back to 628 Watts/m². While we lose a lot of energy due to this scattering effect a little bit may per recuperated. Some of the scattered light from rays passing overhead now reaches our panels.</p>

<h4>Putting it all together</h4>
<p>Now that we have created functions for the most important effects at play it’s time to put them together and create a master function that will estimate the maximal power yield of the solar installation when we feed it the position of the Sun.</p>

  return(max_plant_power)
}</code></pre>
<p>We can now call this function on the dataset with solar positions for a full year which we created earlier on.</p>

<h4>Visualizing maximal efficieny per solar position</h4>
<p>Most of the time when the panels yield less than what is theoretically possible, clouds are spoiling the party.

Since we have 2 years of solar data in the dataset we now have registered 14 days for each week of the year. For clouds to appear as a stationary object in our analysis it would have to be cloudy on a particular time of the day for all 14 days measured. Even for Belgium this is rarely the case.</p>

<p>Et voilà! The objects we detected do indeed match the trees we suspected all along. We’ve successfully used the Sun to scan the surroundings for objects using solar panel data! The panels estimate the tree to the east to be taller but this is because the picture was taken on the side of the roof furthest from the tree. To the panels on the other side of the roof the tree seems taller.</p>
<p>I expect this to be the final post on this dataset and hope you enjoyed the analysis as much as I did. Time for a new pet project. Cheers!</p>
