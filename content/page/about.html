<p>I’m a data scientist living in Antwerp (Belgium) with a background in evolutionary biology. During my PhD in eco-evolutionary dynamics I discovered my interest in programming. After a short detour in Delphi Pascal I started working with Python and got hooked fast. For my research I built a variety of individual based simulation models producing a lot of data along the way. This data was analysed using R, a programming language I was first introduced to during a statistics course in 2007. After my PhD (2015) I decided to follow my interest in programming and data analysis and started working at a <a href="https://www.cobundu.com/">software firm</a> that specializes in smart building / IoT applications. During my time there my activities included: gathering and pre-processing data from <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a> using R interfaces for <a href="https://spark.rstudio.com/">Spark</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ianmcook/implyr">Impala</a>, data <a href="http://tidyr.tidyverse.org/">tidying</a> and <a href="http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/">wrangling</a>, building models, visualizing data with <a href="http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a>, <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/">leaflet</a>, and building dashboards using <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a>. After 3 years of wrangling sensor data I felt the need to expand my machine learning knowledge and joined the aplied AI startup <a href="https://www.faktion.com/">Faktion</a>. At Faktion I switched back to Python I’m excited to build experience working with Jupyter, Pandas, scikit-learn in a team of machine learning experts.</p>
