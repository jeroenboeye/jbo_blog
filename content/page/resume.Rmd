### Tools

* R (main data science tool)
* SQL (Spark, Impala, Orcale, MSSQL)
* Python (Monte carlo individual based simulations + some experiments with scikit-learn & keras, hoping to use Pandas for data science in the future too)


### Experience

##### Data Scientist, [MCS solutions](https://www.mcssolutions.com/)
2015-present
 
Sensor data analysis:

* Combining datasets from multiple sources (Hadoop, Oracle, local files (XML, csv, JSON, excel :cold_sweat: ...))
* Building R-packages
* Tailor visualisations for any dataset
* Building interactive dashboards
* Get actionable insights from data and report to clients
* Set up logging and email alerts for scheduled analyses
* Forecast comfort conditions (CO2, temperature, humidity)
* Forecast battery drainage
* Apply a range of machine learning techniques ([Random forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest), [GLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model), [PCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis), [Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering), regression, [Anomaly detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly_detection),...) + Experiment with neural nets

Custom analyses:

* Vulnerability assessment of global supply chain
* Optimize office layout based on employee activities
* Geotagging addresses and spatial analysis
* Survey analysis

##### PhD student, [Ghent university](http://www.ecology.ugent.be/terec/)
2011-2015
 
Building complex individual based Monte Carlo models in a spatial context (using Python) and run them on [High Performance Computing infrastructure](https://www.ugent.be/hpc/en). Scientific writing and talks. Mentoring students during their Master thesis and teaching. International collaborations.
