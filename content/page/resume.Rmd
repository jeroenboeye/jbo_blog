### Profile

I enjoy getting insights out of data using programming tools. During my PhD I've learned how to approach complex problems and communicate the results to both expert and non-expert audiences. I have strong data wrangling and visualization skills and typically come up with first results sooner than expected. I'm always keen to expand my technical toolkit and learn new concepts to get more angles while tackling a problem.


### Tools

* R (main data science tool)
* SQL (Spark, Impala, Oracle, MSSQL)
* Python (Monte carlo individual based simulations + some experiments with scikit-learn & keras, hoping to use Pandas for data science in the future too)


### Experience

##### Data Scientist, [MCS solutions](https://www.mcssolutions.com/)
2015-present
 
Sensor data analysis:

* Combining data sets from multiple sources (Hadoop, Oracle, local files (xml, csv, json, excel...))
* Building R-packages
* Tailoring visualizations for any data set
* Building interactive dashboards
* Getting actionable insights from data and report to clients
* Setting up logging and email alerts for scheduled analyses
* Forecasting comfort conditions (CO2, temperature, humidity)
* Forecasting battery drainage
* Applying a range of machine learning techniques ([Random forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest), [GLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model), [PCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis), [Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering), regression, [Anomaly detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly_detection),...) + Experiment with neural nets

Custom analyses:

* Vulnerability assessment of global supply chain
* Optimize office layout based on employee activities
* Geo tagging addresses and spatial analysis
* Survey analysis

##### PhD student, [Ghent university](http://www.ecology.ugent.be/terec/)
2011-2015
 
Building complex individual based Monte Carlo models in a spatial context (using Python) and run them on [High Performance Computing infrastructure](https://www.ugent.be/hpc/en). Scientific writing and talks. Mentoring students during their Master thesis and teaching. International collaborations.
